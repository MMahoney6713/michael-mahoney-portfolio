            <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Upstate New York where I enjoyed the beautiful fall foliage, summers on the lake, and the snowy winters. I went to school for Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University, where I spent my time leading a team building <a href="https://cuauv.org">robot submarines</a> and connecting with students through Cru, a Christian fellowship. While working as a Product Design Engineer for an automotive company near Cornell, it was through Cru that I met my wonderful wife, Cynthia. We're now settled into our home in the San Francisco Bay Area, excited for the future chapters of our life together!</p>

            <h2>My Journey into Software Development</h2>
            <p>When I was a student, I had a number of opportunities to enjoy early tastes of being a programmer. MATLAB and Python courses taught me some of the fundamentals of programming, and were great opportunities to read through and help younger students learn and debug their code - which I really enjoyed. My favorite single week at Cornell was when I designed and built (software, electronics, and structure included) a small sumo-robot for my mechatronics class competition.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t until 2020, though, that I started to get serious about pursuing a career as a software engineer. I've been introduced to amazing new perspectives about how technology impacts people; for instance, how AI can and has perpetuated biases in facial recognition software. I’ve thought about how HR systems could deeply value personal growth and connection in employees, or even how an AI empowered software could help people to talk through and manage conflict. There are so many possibilities for a software engineer to build something that transforms people.</p>
            <p>I began my self-study journey started with Harvard’s CS50 online course. It was an awesome introduction to programming in C and Python, teaching me things like data structures and algorithms, memory and stacks, and culminating in SQL and web development. Through the course I would excitedly talk with my wife about things like pointers/memory, hashing, and tries! I decided I was ready to commit to the career change and enrolled in a software engineering bootcamp named “Springboard”. The course is a 9 month self-paced program, and I’ve been busy learning web development using JavaScript/Python, HTML/CSS, React, Flask/Django/Node-Express, PostgreSQL, data structures/algorithms, and software testing principles. More than just online lessons, though, it also offers 1 on 1 weekly mentorship with an experienced software engineer. </p>
            <p>As I look forward to continuing in my learning, my major goal is to finish my bootcamp and land a job where I can grow in developing software that helps transform people!</p>

    <h2>(Some) Personal Interests</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
            <p>Since moving to the Bay Area, we've found that many folks around here are avid rock climbers. Having previously thought that rock climbing was about doing one pull-up after another, I've enjoyed finding that it actually involves a lot of problem solving and technique. You'll find me at Planet Granite Santa Clara, where I'm working on V3's/V4's and eagerly learning and practicing.</p>
            <h3>Coffee (Roasting and Brewing)</h3>
            <p>I've been roasting my own coffee on and off since mid-2020, and am enjoying immersing myself in the art of coffee roasting and brewing. I love the DIY community around the at-home-coffee-roasting scene, and am currently working on perfecting a stovetop-popcorn-popper roast as well as a chemex brew.</p>

            <h3 class="my-4">3D printing</h3>
            <p>I've played around with 3D printers since college, starting with FDM (filament-based) printers. Since 2020 I've owned two 3D printers, an FDM printer and an SLA (resin-based) printer, and have enjoyed learning how to use and optimize each for different applications. I'll design and print household accessories, tiny robots, cases for electronics and 3D scans of people/things. Keep a lookout in my projects section - soon I hope to design and 3D print my own 3D printers, CNC routers, and laser cutters</p>
            <h3>Leadership Development</h3>
            <p>In my time leading teams in building robot submarines, designing automotive timing drives, and launching new campus fellowships across the world, I've always enjoyed working with and developing others - you'll sometimes find me reading articles/books to grow in that. One of my favorite tools to work with is the Clifton Strengths Assessment - my strengths are Connectedness, Restorative, Developer, Intellection, and Input.</p>
